The net-zero-dri scoping project has several focus areas to ensure it provides a clear recommendation on how UKRI can achieve carbon neutral computing by 2040 (or earlier). Further information will be added to this website as the project progresses. 

# Mapping the current carbon landcape
UKRI doesn't currently have a clear understanding about the carbon footprint of its digital research infrastructure estate. This project will design a detailed database/model which will help map what the current carbon landscape looks like. This will include detailed information, likely to be in a database form, that can be used to support modelling applications. It will also provide interactive visualisations and aggregations of the data - which will help UKRI's future understanding of how it can meet its net zero targets. 

# Bringing together experts 
This project covers the entire UKRI digital research infrastructure estate - from supercomputers to the thousands of staff laptops. We will convene a *Net Zero DRI Consortium* with representatives from across UKRI. This will ensure all areas of the organisation are covered by the project. 

# Exploring challenges and opportunities 
A programme of workshops will be facilitated to cover the full range of challenges and opportunities around the Net Zero topic

# Developing case studies
To gain a deeper understanding into existing digital research infrastructures, the project will perform in-depth examplar case studies e.g. JASMIN and ARCHER2

# Funding proof-of-concept studies 
The project will fund ~5 proof-of-concept studies to analyse the implementation of carbon and energy efficiency measures.  

# Investigating funding and system level views 
Existing processes, such as procurement, don't take into account carbon costs. This work area will investigate the funding framework and system level view e.g. what does "net zero" mean?, the "best value" requirement in procurement processes
